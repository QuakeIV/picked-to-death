I created this simplistic version of a dev log so that we can communicate 
what we are doing easier. It is very simple however so text doesn't 
align itself, which means you have to limit yourself when typing into it.
I also strongly suggest that you add text at the top  of the file rather
than the bottom, mainly so that it's easy to see what was added. 

I messed with the login stuff a bit, changed the enter game confirmation 
to an alert window with a yes no button. Added this dev log, started work
on making the name and gender display in the start window, there needs
to be a way to refresh the window after each button is clicked. 

A possible suggestion: make this entire process be inside of a proc that 
is called in the Login() code. 

mob/human
	Login() 
		Proc_call_of_login_code() 
		..()

proc/Proc_call_of_login_code()
	[your existing login code] 

This may make it easier to update the screen and what not, and should make 
it possible to view the login screen at other times than just when you are
about to bind yourself to a human, there may be times when you want to 
access the name changing/gender changing abilities without having to become 
an active player.
